Big Video is an open source project for Meteor that will provide a video background to your app.

You can demo the project at http://big-video.meteor.com/

Required Meteor Packages
    `jquery-ui
    modernizr-meteor
    iron-router
    iron-router-progress`

Currently runs on Meteor `0.8.1.1`

To install you will need to add a video to /public/vid that will play in the background. For better performance consider adding a photo of the video in /public/img that will load first to improve performance.
