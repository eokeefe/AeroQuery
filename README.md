Big Video

Open source Meteor app that will provide a video background to your app

Required Meteor Packages
    jquery-ui
    modernizr-meteor
    iron-router
    iron-router-progress

Since videos and photos are not stored in Git, you will have to add a photo in /public/img that will load first. Ideally this should be a photos that looks like the video so to create a seamless transition.

Next add the video to /public/vid, which will run once it is fully loaded.
